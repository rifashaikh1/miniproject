    <h1>What is Cancer?</h1><br>
    <p>
        Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. 
        These cells can form tumors or invade surrounding tissues and organs. It can occur in almost any part of the body 
        and may spread to other areas through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Early detection and treatment are crucial 
        for managing cancer and improving outcomes. </section>

           <b>Overview:</b>Lymphoma is a type of cancer that begins in the lymphatic system, a vital part of the immune system,
 which includes the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and bone marrow. Lymphoma occurs when lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell,
 grow uncontrollably and form tumors in the lymph nodes or other parts of the lymphatic system. It is one of the most common blood cancers. <br>
 <b>Symptoms:</b> - *Swollen lymph nodes*: Painless swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin.
- *Fever*: Persistent or recurring without an infection.
- *Night sweats*.
- *Unexplained weight loss*.
- *Fatigue*.
- *Shortness of breath* or cough: Due to swollen lymph nodes pressing on the lungs.
- *Itchy skin*.
- *Abdominal pain or swelling*: If the lymphoma affects lymph nodes in the abdomen.
. <br>
<b>Risk Factors:</b>1. *Weakened immune system*: People with autoimmune diseases or those taking immunosuppressive drugs after organ transplants are at higher risk.
2. *Infections*: Certain viral and bacterial infections are linked to lymphoma, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HIV, and Helicobacter pylori.
3. *Age*: Hodgkin lymphoma is more common in young adults (15-40) and older adults (over 55). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk increases with age, typically affecting people over 60.
4. *Family history*: A family history of lymphoma may increase risk.

        <div class="panc" id="panc">
           <strong> 7. Pancreatic Cancer</strong><br>
           <b>Overview:</b> Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the tissues of the pancreas, 
a gland located behind the stomach. The pancreas plays a critical role in digestion by producing enzymes that help break down 
food and hormones like insulin that regulate blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer is known for its aggressive nature and is often detected at a late stage,
 which makes it one of the deadliest forms of cancer.

 <br>
 <b>Symptoms:</b> 1. *Jaundice*: Yellowing of the skin and eyes due to bile duct obstruction caused by the tumor.
2. *Abdominal or back pain*: A common symptom, often occurring as the cancer grows and presses on surrounding organs or nerves.
3. *Unexplained weight loss*: Rapid and unintentional weight loss can be an early warning sign.
4. *Loss of appetite*.
5. *Nausea and vomiting*.
6. *New-onset diabetes*: Especially in people over 50 without a prior history of diabetes.
7. *Changes in stool*: Pale, greasy stools that float (steatorrhea) due to improper digestion of fats.
8. *Fatigue*.
9. *Blood clots*: Unexplained blood clots can sometimes be associated with pancreatic cancer.
 <br>
 <b>Risk Factors:</b>1. *Smoking*: Smoking significantly increases the risk, with smokers being two to three times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer.
2. *Age*: Most cases are diagnosed in people over 60, with the risk increasing with age.
3. *Family history*: A family history of pancreatic cancer or other cancers can increase risk due to inherited genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1/BRCA2).
4. *Chronic pancreatitis*: Long-term inflammation of the pancreas, often caused by heavy alcohol use or genetic conditions, can raise the risk.
5. *Diabetes*: There is a strong link between long-standing diabetes and pancreatic cancer, although the exact relationship is not fully understood.
6. *Obesity*: Being overweight or obese is a risk factor.
 <br>
 <b>Treatment:</b> Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation.

        <div class="prost" id="prost">
         <strong>   8. Prostate Cancer</strong><br>
         <b>Overview: </b>Occurs in the prostate, a gland in men that produces seminal fluid. <br>
            <b>Symptoms:</b>1. *Urinary symptoms*:
- Frequent urination, especially at night.
- Difficulty starting or stopping urination.
- Painful urination or blood in the urine.

2. *Sexual symptoms*:
- Difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction).
- Blood in the semen.

3. *Pain and discomfort*:
- Pain in the lower back, hips, or pelvis may occur if the cancer has spread to the bones.
<br>
<b>Risk Factors:</b>
1. *Age*: The risk increases significantly after the age of 50, and most cases occur in men over 65.
2. *Race*: African-American men have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer and tend to have more aggressive forms of the disease.
3. *Family history: Men with a family history of prostate cancer (especially father or brother) are at higher risk. Inherited mutations like **BRCA1* and *BRCA2* also raise the risk.
4. *Genetics*: Certain genetic mutations, such as those in the BRCA genes, can increase the risk of prostate cancer.
5. *Diet*: A diet high in red meat and high-fat dairy products, along with low vegetable consumption, may slightly increase the risk.
6. *Obesity*: Obesity has been linked to more aggressive forms of prostate cancer.
 <br>
 <b>Treatment:</b> Surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy.

        <div class="skin" id="skin">
          <strong>  9. Skin Cancer</strong><br>
          <b>Overview:</b> cancer is the most common type of cancer, occurring when abnormal cells form in the skin’s 
outer layer due to damage, primarily from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It can develop in any part of the body but most often 
appears on areas frequently exposed to the sun, like the face, neck, arms, and hands.
<br>
<b>Symptoms:</b> 1 <li> Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)*:</li>
- Pearly or waxy bumps, often with visible blood vessels.
- Flat, flesh-colored, or brown scars-like lesions.
- Bleeding or scabbing sores that don’t heal.

2. *Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)*:
- Firm, red nodules.
- Scaly, crusted growths that may bleed or develop into open sores.

3. *Melanoma*:
- A new mole or changes in an existing mole, such as asymmetry, irregular borders, uneven color, or an increase in size.
- Moles that itch, bleed, or become painful.
- Brownish spots with darker speckles.
- Dark lesions on the palms, soles, or under fingernails and toenails.
<br>
<b>Risk Factors:</b> 1. *UV radiation exposure*: The primary cause of skin cancer, UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds, damages the DNA of skin cells, leading to abnormal growth.
2. *Fair skin*: People with fair skin, light-colored eyes, and red or blonde hair are at higher risk because they have less melanin, which offers some protection against UV rays.
3. *History of sunburns*: Repeated blistering sunburns, especially during childhood, increase the risk of skin cancer later in life.
4. *Moles*: Having many moles or atypical (dysplastic) moles increases the risk of melanoma.
 <br>
<b>Treatment:</b>Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy.

           <strong> 10. Uterine Cancer</strong><br>
           <b>Overview: </b>Forms in the uterus, commonly affecting the endometrial lining.It occurs when abnormal cells form in the lining of the uterus 
(endometrium). The majority of uterine cancers are endometrial cancers, although cancer can also develop in the muscles or other supporting 
tissues of the uterus, known as **uterine sarcoma*. 
<br>
<b>Symptoms: </b>
1. *Abnormal vaginal bleeding*: This is the most common symptom, especially after menopause. Any postmenopausal bleeding should be investigated.
2. *Unusual discharge*: Watery or blood-tinged discharge without the presence of blood can be a sign of early uterine cancer.
3. *Pelvic pain*: Pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen or pelvis, particularly in more advanced stages.
4. *Pain during intercourse*.
 <br>
 <b>Risk Factors:</b>. *Age*: Most cases occur in postmenopausal women, typically in their 50s and 60s.
3. *Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)*: Women who take estrogen without progesterone after menopause have a higher risk of developing uterine cancer.
4. *Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)*: Women with PCOS have higher estrogen levels, which may increase their risk.
5. *Early menstruation or late menopause*: A longer exposure to estrogen due to early onset of menstruation (before age 12) or late menopause (after age 55) increases the risk.
6. *Family history: A family history of uterine cancer or hereditary conditions like **Lynch syndrome* increases the risk.
7. *Never having been pregnant*: Women who have not had children may have a higher risk of developing uterine cancer.
